# Convera Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
* Convera Convera (formerly known as Western Union Business Solutions) is one of the world’s largest non-bank FinTechs in global B2B payments, with capabilities in over 140 currencies across more than 200 countries and territories and 60 global banking partners.

Convera is subject to a large amount of AML and KYC regulations for the services they provide. Clients would be sent legal forms and required an official (JP or Police Officer) to sign them off for verification purposes. This process made for a long, complex verification process that required added internal resources. To make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a backlog of clients needing identification and verification – checks that Convera was unable to complete.
